My name is Jessica Gonzalez and I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University and am also a Teachers Assistance in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Prior to attending Northeastern, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Anthropology from Purdue University and served in AmeriCorps in Omaha, Nebraska. Upon being accepted to Northeastern, I received a National Science Foundation Scholarship. I am interested in taking a holistic approach in my career by combining social sciences in technology to help improve social services. As a first-generation, Mexican American, queer woman of color, Jessica is taking a holistic approach to her career by combining social sciences in technology to help improve social services. During my free time I enjoy perfecting a good cup of coffee to enjoy on my patio.
